**CRITICAL Plugin NOTES:**

[CRITICAL](https://github.com/addyosmani/critical "Critical Github")

Are there any sample projects available using Critical?
Why, yes!. [Take a look at this](https://github.com/addyosmani/critical-path-css-demo "Critical Path CSS") Gulp project which demonstrates using Critical to generate and inline critical-path CSS. It also includes a mini-tutorial that walks through how to use it in a simple webapp.


**GULP Node NOTES:**
If you’ve globally installed gulp before, you’ll want to remove the old version. To check your version, run:

`> gulp -v`

If you don’t see CLI Version 1.x (as shown above), remove your old installation by running:

`npm rm --global gulp`

Now, you can install the standalone CLI using:

`npm install --global gulp-cli`

Run gulp -v again. Everything should match the screenshot above.
